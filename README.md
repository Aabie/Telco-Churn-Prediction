# 📊 **Telco Churn Prediction: Leveraging Data for Customer Retention** 📉📱

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** in the telecommunications industry. The goal is to analyze customer data and build predictive models that can identify customers who are at risk of leaving the service. By predicting churn, businesses can implement proactive retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Customer Demographics:** Age, gender, contract type, etc.
- **Usage Patterns:** Monthly charges, tenure, number of services, etc.
- **Service-Related Factors:** Internet service, phone service, etc.

## 🛠 Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Gathered customer data including demographics, usage history, service-related features, and churn status.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.

3. **Modeling:**  
   - Implemented various machine learning models including:  
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Random Forests**

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluated models using key metrics such as:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**

## 🎯 Objective
The main objective of this project is to build machine learning models that:
- **Accurately predict churn** by identifying patterns in customer data.
- Enable businesses to take **data-driven actions** for customer retention.
- Improve **customer satisfaction** and reduce churn by addressing the needs of at-risk customers.
